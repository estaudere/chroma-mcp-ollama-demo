# TODO

- [ ] implement persistent messages (in one context window, keep memory)
- [ ] implement feedback as model is being loaded/processing query (UI/UX)
- [ ] implement "hooks" to save information before/after generation (requires another API call with user-specified prompt?)
- [ ] async generation + streaming
